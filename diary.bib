  abstract = {Models of self-regulation propose that negative affect is generated when progress towards goals is perceived to be inadequate. Similarly, ruminative thinking is hypothesised to be triggered by unattained goals (Martin Tesser, 1996). We conducted an experience-sampling study in which participants recorded their negative affect, ruminative self-focus, and goal appraisals eight times daily for one week. Negative affect and ruminative self-focus were each associated with low levels of goal success and (with the exception of sadness) high levels of goal importance. As predicted, the combination of low goal success and high goal importance was associated with the highest levels of negative affect, and this interaction was marginally significant for ruminative self-focus. Decomposition of the ruminative self-focus measure revealed that the success by importance interaction was significantly associated with focus on problems but not focus on feelings. Findings did not differ for individuals reporting high versus low levels of depressive symptoms or trait rumination. These results suggest that self-regulatory models of goal pursuit provide a useful explanatory framework for the study of affect and ruminative thinking in everyday life.},

  volume = {123},
  issn = {0021843X},
  abstract = {Rumination has been robustly implicated in the onset and maintenance of depression. However, despite empirically well-supported theories of the consequences of trait rumination (response styles theory; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991), and of the processes underlying state episodes of goal-oriented repetitive thought (control theory; Martin \& Tesser, 1989, 1996), the relationship between these theories remains unresolved. Further, less theoretical and clinical attention has been paid to the maintenance and treatment of trait depressive rumination. We propose that conceptualizing rumination as a mental habit (Hertel, 2004) helps to address these issues. Elaborating on this account, we propose a framework linking the response styles and control theories via a theoretical approach to the relationship between habits and goals (Wood \& Neal, 2007). In this model, with repetition in the same context, episodes of self-focused repetitive thought triggered by goal discrepancies can become habitual, through a process of automatic association between the behavioral response (i.e., repetitive thinking) and any context that occurs repeatedly with performance of the behavior (e.g., physical location, mood), and in which the repetitive thought is contingent on the stimulus context. When the contingent response involves a passive focus on negative content and abstract construal, the habit of depressive rumination is acquired. Such habitual rumination is cued by context independent of goals and is resistant to change. This habit framework has clear treatment implications and generates novel testable predictions.},

Thus, when a person makes evaluative judgments or engages in a task, positive affect can enhance evaluations and empower potential responses. Rather than affect itself, the information conveyed by affect is crucial. Tests of the hypothesis find that affective influences can be made to disappear by changing the source to which the affect is attributed. In tasks, positive affect validates and negative affect invalidates accessible cognitions, leading to relational processing and item-specific processing, respectively. Positive affect is found to promote, and negative affect to inhibit, many textbook phenomena from cognitive psychology.},

Rumination can be triggered by the awareness of a discrepancy between one's current state of being and one's desired state of being. Such discrepancies may partly underlie the phenomenon of reduced AMS (a.k.a. overgeneral memory), which is a phenomenon of great clinical importance especially for depression. The aim of the present studies was to experimentally investigate the impact of a self-discrepancy manipulation on AMS in a student sample (Study 1) and in a depressed sample (Study 2). Results failed to reveal a direct effect of a self-discrepancy manipulation on AMS, but in both studies, actual{\textendash}ideal discrepancies interacted with the reflection component of rumination with respect to memory specificity. In the self-discrepancy condition, there was a negative association between reflection and change in AMS: Higher reflection was associated with a greater decrease in AMS from pre- to post-testing. The results of these two studies suggest that the interplay between components of rumination and self-discrepancy has an effect on memory specificity.},

According to this view OGM is regarded as a learned cognitive avoidance strategy, based on principles of operant conditioning; i.e., individuals learn to avoid the emotionally painful consequences associated with the retrieval of specific negative memories. The aim of the present study was to test one of the basic assumptions of the functional avoidance account, namely that autobiographical memory retrieval can be brought under operant control. Here 41 students were instructed to retrieve personal memories in response to 60 emotional cue words. Depending on the condition, they were punished with an aversive sound for the retrieval of specific or nonspecific memories in an operant conditioning procedure. Analyzes showed that the course of memory specificity significantly differed between conditions. After the procedure participants punished for nonspecific memories retrieved significantly more specific memories compared to participants punished for specific memories. However, whereas memory specificity significantly increased in participants punished for specific memories, it did not significantly decrease in participants punished for nonspecific memories. Thus, while our findings indicate that autobiographical memory retrieval can be brought under operant control, they do not support a functional avoidance view on OGM.},

We review the aspects of the response styles theory that have been well-supported, including evidence that rumination exacerbates depression, enhances negative thinking, impairs problem solving, interferes with instrumental behavior, and erodes social support. Next, we address contradictory and new findings. Specifically, rumination appears to more consistently predict the onset of depression rather than the duration, but rumination interacts with negative cognitive styles to predict, the duration of depressive symptoms. Contrary to original predictions, the use of positive distractions has not consistently been correlated with lower levels of depressive symptoms in correlational studies, although dozens of experimental studies show positive distractions relieve depressed mood. Further, evidence now suggests that rumination is associated with psychopathologies in addition to depression, including anxiety, binge eating, binge drinking, and self-harm. We discuss the relationships between rumination and worry and between rumination and other coping or emotion-regulation strategies. Finally, we highlight recent research on the distinction between rumination and more adaptive forms of self-reflection, on basic cognitive deficits or biases in rumination, on its neural and genetic correlates, and on possible interventions to combat rumination.},

  abstract = {Rumination has been widely studied and is a crucial component in the study of cognitive vulnerabilities to depression. However, rumination means different things in the context of different theories, and has not been uniformly defined or measured. This article aims to review models of rumination, as well as the various ways in which it is assessed. The models are compared and contrasted with respect to several important dimensions of rumination. Guidelines to consider in the selection of a model and measure of rumination are presented, and suggestions for the conceptualization of rumination are offered. In addition, rumination's relation to other similar constructs is evaluated. Finally, future directions for the study of ruminative phenomena are presented. It is hoped that this article will be a useful guide to those interested in studying the multi-faceted construct of rumination.},

The Experience-Sampling Method (ESM) is an attempt to provide a valid instrument to describe variations in self-reports of mental processes. It can be used to obtain empirical data on the following types of variables: a) frequency and patterning of daily activity, social interaction, and changes in location; b) frequency, intensity, and patterning of psychological states, i.e., emotional, cognitive, and conative dimensions of experience; c) frequency and patterning of thoughts, including quality and intensity of thought disturbance. The article reviews practical and methodological issues of the ESM and presents evidence for its short- and long-term reliability when used as an instrument for assessing the variables outlined above. It also presents evidence for validity by showing correlation between ESM measures on the one hand and physiological measures, one-time psychological tests, and behavioral indices on the other. A number of studies with normal and clinical populations that have used the ESM are reviewed to demonstrate the range of issues to which the technique can be usefully applied.},

Adapting a methodology developed by Langlois et al. (Behav. Res. Therapy 38 (2000) 157-173), this study directly compared worry and rumination in a non-clinical population across a series of variables drawn from current models (appraisal, general descriptors and emotional reactions). Each of 149 female volunteers, with a wide range of age and backgrounds, identified a ruminative thought and a different worry and subsequently evaluated them using the Cognitive Intrusion Questionnaire. Significant within-subject differences were revealed on seven variables: chronicity, unpleasantness, reality of problem, future orientation, past orientation, feelings of worry and insecurity. There were no differences found between worry and rumination on appraisals and strategies, consistent with accounts that propose that worry and rumination share the same processes but involve different content (Cognitive Ther.

In the second part of this study we examined whether these components of rumination were differentially related to cognitive biases in depression. Overall, the MDD group exhibited higher brooding scores than did all other groups; SP and FD groups did not differ from each other but obtained higher brooding scores than did the control participants. Only the MDD and the control groups differed on the reflective pondering factor. Importantly, brooding and reflective pondering were differentially related to cognitive biases. Specifically, the correlation between brooding/reflective pondering and memory bias was not significant when depressive symptoms were partialed out. The correlation between brooding and attentional bias for sad faces, however, remained significant even when current depressive symptoms were taken into account. In sum, our results support the formulation that rumination is composed of an adaptive reflective pondering factor and a maladaptive brooding factor.},

Effect sizes became non-significant when outliers were excluded and after adjustment for publication bias. The quality of the RCTs was suboptimal. Conclusions CBM may have small effects on mental health problems, but it is also very well possible that there are no significant clinically relevant effects. Research in this field is hampered by small and low-quality trials, and by risk of publication bias. Many positive outcomes are driven by extreme outliers.},

In the present study, the authors addressed this issue by experimentally inducing biased attentional response to emotionally negative stimuli, using a home-based attentional training program and then examining the influence of this attentional manipulation on trait anxiety scores and on state anxiety responses to a subsequent stressful life event. The attentional bias modification procedure was effective in inducing attentional avoidance of negative information. Furthermore, this attentional manipulation served to reduce trait anxiety scores and to attenuate state anxiety responses to the subsequent naturalistic stressor. These findings support the hypotheses that biased attentional responding to emotionally negative information contributes causally to real-world anxiety vulnerability.

"Simultaneous replication designs are the designs in which the replications (phase or alternation single-case experiments) are carried out at the same time. The most familiar simultaneous replication design is the multiple baseline design across participants. In such a multiple baseline design, several AB phase designs are implemented simultaneously, and the intervention is applied sequentially across the patients.2,57-59 The simultaneity allows for a relative control of historical confounding factors. If an intervention is introduced in one of the AB designs and produces a change for that patient, whereas little or no change is observed for the other patients, then it is less likely that other external events were responsible for the observed change than if this change was observed in an isolated AB design." (Onghena and Edgington 2005:5)
"In early applications of multiple baseline designs, the intervention points were fixed for the separate designs, and only the order in which the patients received the treatment was randomly determined.61-63 Of course, random determination of the intervention points, as in randomized phase designs, also randomizes the order in which the patients receive the treatment if simultaneous intervention points for the separate subjects are avoided.56,64,65" (Onghena and Edgington 2005:5)
"Sequential replication designs are the designs in which the replications are carried out one by one. Three types of strategies have been distinguished: direct replication, systematic replication, and clinical replication. Direct replication is replication of the same experiment with another patient; systematic replication is replication of the experiment under different circumstances (another setting, another experimenter, another time of day, etc.); and clinical replication is the administration by the same practitioner of a treatment package containing 2 or more treatment procedures to a series of patients presenting similar combinations of multiple behavioral and emotional problems. 2,9" (Onghena and Edgington 2005:5)

If the null hypothesis is true, which means that there is no differential effect of the levels of the independent variable, then it does not matter which level of the independent variable is administered at a certain measurement occasion, ie, the observed scores can be considered as fixed scores that would have been obtained whatever ordering was selected. Therefore, the probability to obtain a test statistic that is larger than or equal to the observed value of the test statistic by pure chance can be calculated by keeping the scores fixed, superimposing the 20 possible orderings, and calculating and sorting the test statistics. Table 1 shows the result for our small numerical example." (Onghena and Edgington 2005:7)
"Several meta-analytical procedures for single-case studies have been proposed in the literature,94-97 and we demonstrate one, P value combining, which is consistent with the randomization test approach followed for the previous 3 types of designs and has the advantages that it is broadly applicable and that it are distribution-free without converting the scores to ranks or signs.98-100" (Onghena and Edgington 2005:9)
"Notice that although none of the individual P values is smaller than any acceptable significance level, the combined P value is (smaller than = 0.05), which demonstrates the statistical power of this approach. The researchers may have concluded that there was no statistical evidence that the regimen was effective based on the data from any one of the experiments, but the combination of experiments shows that there are effective ingredients and that the therapy should not be abandoned without further notice. It might be worthwhile to design follow-up single-case experiments with more observations or more phases to obtain statistically significant results at the individual level. Also, further research might concentrate on isolating the effective ingredients and making the therapy more efficient." (Onghena and Edgington 2005:9)
"In general, the test statistic has to be chosen in accordance to the kind of effects one expects or predicts. A nondirectional randomization test, for example, can be constructed by using the absolute difference between the means. Furthermore, other statistics can be used to test for other kinds of predicted effects: differences between medians, the ratio of the variances, differences between the slopes, and so on." (Onghena and Edgington 2005:9)
"Which effect size measures are most appropriate for single-case data is a matter of much debate, with Cohen d or f 2, the Reliability of Change index, and {\textcopyright} 2004 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins the Percentage of Nonoverlapping Data metric being the most popular candidates.94,106-110" (Onghena and Edgington 2005:10)},

  abstract = {Visual data analysis is an important first step when evaluating intervention effects. This also holds for analyzing data from single-case experiments. Because most software packages do not offer customized facilities for constructing single-case graphs and are not particularly suited to perform single-case visual data analyses, we created an R package to help researchers in making graphical representations of single-case data and to transform graphical displays back to raw data. In addition to a basic plotting function, we included some tools to facilitate the use of three interpretative principles for visually analyzing single-case data: plotting a measure of central location as a horizontal reference line; displaying variability with (trimmed) range bars, range lines, and trended ranges; and displaying trends with a vertical line graph, by fitting a robust linear trend, or by plotting running medians. Finally, we included a function to extract raw data values from published graphs.},

However, little is known about how the dimensions of emotional arousal and valence interact with the lexicosemantic properties of words such as age of acquisition, familiarity, and imageability, that determine word recognition performance. This study aimed to examine these relationships using English ratings for affective and lexicosemantic features. Eighty-two native English speakers rated 300 words for emotional valence, arousal, familiarity, age of acquisition, and imageability. Although both dimensions of emotion were correlated with lexicosemantic variables, a unique emotion cluster produced the strongest quadratic relationship. This finding suggests that emotion should be included in models of word recognition as it is likely to make an independent contribution.},

Despite marked advances in this area, there is a lack of integration between psychopathology and cognitive (neuro) science research. We propose the `impaired disengagement' hypothesis as a unifying framework between both approaches. The core tenet of our model is that prolonged processing of self-referent material is due to impaired attentional disengagement from negative self-referent information. We discuss empirical evidence for this framework and outline future ways in which the causal predictions of this model can be tested. The proposed framework can account for effectiveness of various treatments for depression and may aid in devising new interventions to target depressive cognition.},

  title = {Cognitive bias modification to prevent depression ({COPE}): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial},
  volume = {15},
  abstract = {Background: Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide and, although efficacious treatments are
available, their efficacy is suboptimal and recurrence of symptoms is common. Effective preventive strategies could
reduce disability and the long term social and health complications associated with the disorder, but current
options are limited. Cognitive bias modification (CBM) is a novel, simple, and safe intervention that addresses
attentional and interpretive biases associated with anxiety, dysphoria, and depression. The primary aim of this trial is
to determine if CBM decreases the one-year onset of a major depressive episode among adults with subsyndromal
depression.
Design and methods: This randomised controlled trial will recruit 532 adults with subsyndromal symptoms of
depression living in the Australian community (parallel design, 1:1 allocation ratio). Participants will be free of
clinically significant symptoms of depression and of psychotic disorders, sensory and cognitive impairment, and
risky alcohol use. The CBM intervention will target attentional and interpretive biases associated with depressive
symptoms. The sessions will be delivered via the internet over a period of 52 weeks. The primary outcome of
interest is the onset of a major depressive episode according the DSM-IV-TR criteria over a 12-month period. Sec-
ondary outcomes of interest include change in the severity of depressive symptoms as measured by the Patient
Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), use of antidepressants or benzodiazepines, and changes in attention and interpretive
biases. The assessment of outcomes will take place 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after randomisation and will occur via
the internet.
Discussion: We propose to test the efficacy of an innovative intervention that is well grounded in theory and for
which increasing empirical evidence for an effect on mood is available. The intervention is simple, inexpensive, easy
to access, and could be easily rolled out into practice if our findings confirm a role for CBM in the prevention of
depression.

We review research that has sought to evaluate the causal contributions such biases make to anxiety dysfunction and to therapeutically alleviate anxiety using cognitive-bias modification (CBM) procedures. After considering the purpose and nature of CBM methodologies, we show that variants designed to modify selective attention (CBM-A) or interpretation (CBM-I) have proven capable of reducing anxiety vulnerability and ameliorating dysfunctional anxiety. In addition to supporting the causal role of cognitive bias in anxiety vulnerability and dysfunction and illuminating the mechanisms that underpin such bias, the findings suggest that CBM procedures may have therapeutic promise within clinical settings. We discuss key issues within this burgeoning field of research and suggest future directions CBM research should take to maximize its theoretical and applied value.

Dear <participant>,

This is a reminder to complete {\textquotedbl}A computer task to reduce rumination: daily tasks{\textquotedbl}. Follow
the instructions below in order, making sure you enter the correct session number (and subject number if necessary).

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Computer task (takes about 5 minutes early in the study, and about 15 minutes later in the study).

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Your session number for today is \textbf{34}. Make a note of
    this before running the task as you will need to enter it on the
    first screen.
    \item Before running the task, close all other programs on your computer.
    \item Please avoid interruptions (e.g. turn off mobile phones, TV etc.) so you can focus exclusively on the computer task.
    \item Your subject number is \textbf{12}
  \end{itemize}

  \item Click on this link (<url>) and follow the instructions. (Remember
  to upload your task file on the first screen. Only click
  {\textquotedbl}Return to survey{\textquotedbl} after the
  {\textquotedbl}Uploading...{\textquotedbl} message disappears.)

  \item Delete this email (you will receive new reminders for subsequent sessions in the study).
\end{enumerate}

A copy of the task instructions is attached should you need to refer to them.

Sincerely,

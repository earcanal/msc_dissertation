	abstract = {Visual data analysis is an important first step when evaluating intervention effects. This also holds for analyzing data from single-case experiments. Because most software packages do not offer customized facilities for constructing single-case graphs and are not particularly suited to perform single-case visual data analyses, we created an R package to help researchers in making graphical representations of single-case data and to transform graphical displays back to raw data. In addition to a basic plotting function, we included some tools to facilitate the use of three interpretative principles for visually analyzing single-case data: plotting a measure of central location as a horizontal reference line; displaying variability with (trimmed) range bars, range lines, and trended ranges; and displaying trends with a vertical line graph, by fitting a robust linear trend, or by plotting running medians. Finally, we included a function to extract raw data values from published graphs.},

	abstract = {Rumination has been robustly implicated in the onset and maintenance of depression. However, despite empirically well-supported theories of the consequences of trait rumination (response styles theory; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991), and of the processes underlying state episodes of goal-oriented repetitive thought (control theory; Martin \& Tesser, 1989, 1996), the relationship between these theories remains unresolved. Further, less theoretical and clinical attention has been paid to the maintenance and treatment of trait depressive rumination. We propose that conceptualizing rumination as a mental habit (Hertel, 2004) helps to address these issues. Elaborating on this account, we propose a framework linking the response styles and control theories via a theoretical approach to the relationship between habits and goals (Wood \& Neal, 2007). In this model, with repetition in the same context, episodes of self-focused repetitive thought triggered by goal discrepancies can become habitual, through a process of automatic association between the behavioral response (i.e., repetitive thinking) and any context that occurs repeatedly with performance of the behavior (e.g., physical location, mood), and in which the repetitive thought is contingent on the stimulus context. When the contingent response involves a passive focus on negative content and abstract construal, the habit of depressive rumination is acquired. Such habitual rumination is cued by context independent of goals and is resistant to change. This habit framework has clear treatment implications and generates novel testable predictions.},

Adapting a methodology developed by Langlois et al. (Behav. Res. Therapy 38 (2000) 157-173), this study directly compared worry and rumination in a non-clinical population across a series of variables drawn from current models (appraisal, general descriptors and emotional reactions). Each of 149 female volunteers, with a wide range of age and backgrounds, identified a ruminative thought and a different worry and subsequently evaluated them using the Cognitive Intrusion Questionnaire. Significant within-subject differences were revealed on seven variables: chronicity, unpleasantness, reality of problem, future orientation, past orientation, feelings of worry and insecurity. There were no differences found between worry and rumination on appraisals and strategies, consistent with accounts that propose that worry and rumination share the same processes but involve different content (Cognitive Ther. Res. 24 (2000) 671-688). (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objectives Face-to-face mindfulness interventions have been shown to significantly decrease perceived stress, anxiety and depression and research is beginning to show similar benefits for such courses delivered via the internet. We investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of an online mindfulness course for perceived stress, anxiety and depression.
Design A follow-up investigation of an online mindfulness course. Previous research examining the change in perceived stress showed promising results. Measures of anxiety and depression were added to the online mindfulness course and these were investigated as well as perceived stress using a new, larger sample.
Participants Participants (N=273) were self-referrals to the online course who completed the outcome measure immediately before the course, upon course completion and at 1 month follow-up.
Intervention The programme consists of 10 sessions, guided meditation videos and automated emails, with elements of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy, completed at a pace to suit the individual (minimum length 4 weeks).
Primary and secondary outcome measures The Perceived Stress Scale, the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (for depression). Mindfulness practice was self-reported at automated time points upon login, once the exercises and sessions for each week were completed.
Results Perceived stress, anxiety and depression significantly decreased at course completion and further decreased at 1 month follow-up, with effect sizes comparable to those found with face-to-face and other online mindfulness courses and to other types of intervention, such as cognitive behavioural therapy for stress. The amount of meditation practice reported did affect outcome when controlling for baseline severity.
Conclusions The online mindfulness course appears to be an acceptable, accessible intervention which reduces stress, anxiety and depression. However, there is no control comparison and future research is required to assess the effects of the course for different samples.},

People who engage in ruminative responses to depression, focusing on their symptoms and the possible causes and consequences of their symptoms, will show longer depression than people who take action to distract themselves from their symptoms. Ruminative responses prolong depression because they allow the depressed mood to negatively bias thinking and interfere with instrumental behavior and problem-solving. Laboratory and field studies directly testing this theory have supported its predictions. The author discusses how response styles can explain the greater likelihood of depression in women than men, then integrates this response styles theory with studies of coping with discrete events. The response style theory is compared to other theories of the duration of depression. Finally, suggestions are made that may help a depressed person to stop engaging in ruminative responses and on how response style for depression may develop.

This suggests that reduction of such biases may be a plausible strategy in the treatment of depressive symptoms. The present clinical randomized controlled trial examined long-term effects of a computerized attention bias modification (ABM) procedure on individuals with elevated depressive symptoms.
Methods
In a double-blind study design, 77 individuals with ongoing mild to severe symptoms of depression were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 1) ABM training (n = 27); 2) placebo (n = 27); 3) assessment-only (n = 23). In both the ABM and placebo conditions, participants completed 8 sessions of 216-trials (1728 in total) during a 2-week period. Assessments were conducted at pre-training and post-training (0, 2, 4, 8-week, 3, 7-month follow-ups). Change in depressive symptoms and restoration of asymptomatic level were the primary outcome measures.
Results
In the ABM, but not the other two conditions, significant reductions in depressive symptoms were found at post-training and maintained during the 3-month follow-up. Importantly, more participants remained asymptomatic in the ABM condition, as compared to the other two conditions, from post-training to 7-month follow-up. ABM also significantly reduced secondary outcome measures including rumination and trait anxiety, and notably, the ABM effect on reducing depressive symptoms was mediated by rumination.
Limitation
Generalization of the findings may be limited because the present sample included only college students.
Conclusions
The ABM effect on reducing depressive symptoms was maintained for at least 3-month duration in individuals with elevated depressive symptoms, and these results suggest that ABM may be a useful tool for the prevention of depressive symptoms.

Cognitive training procedures designed to modify selective attentional responding to threat originally were developed to test the hypothesis that this attentional bias causally contributes to anxious disposition. The capacity of attentional bias modification (ABM) training to alleviate dysfunctional anxiety has since attracted growing interest, and the present article reviews studies that have evaluated this therapeutic potential. When intended ABM training has successfully reduced attention to threat, it also has reduced anxiety vulnerability and symptomatology with a high degree of reliability. When the delivery of intended ABM training has not resulted in such anxiety reduction, this typically has reflected the failure to successfully modify attentional selectivity as required. We discuss ways in which ABM training procedures may be refined to optimize their capacity to reduce attentional bias to threat, to improve delivery of the resulting anxiolytic benefits.},

	abstract = {Background
The eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8) is established as a valid diagnostic and severity measure for depressive disorders in large clinical studies. Our objectives were to assess the PHQ-8 as a depression measure in a large, epidemiological population-based study, and to determine the comparability of depression as defined by the PHQ-8 diagnostic algorithm vs. a PHQ-8 cutpoint ≥ 10.
Methods
Random-digit-dialed telephone survey of 198,678 participants in the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS), a population-based survey in the United States. Current depression as defined by either the DSM-IV based diagnostic algorithm (i.e., major depressive or other depressive disorder) of the PHQ-8 or a PHQ-8 score ≥ 10; respondent sociodemographic characteristics; number of days of impairment in the past 30 days in multiple domains of health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
Results
The prevalence of current depression was similar whether defined by the diagnostic algorithm or a PHQ-8 score ≥ 10 (9.1\% vs. 8.6\%). Depressed patients had substantially more days of impairment across multiple domains of HRQoL, and the impairment was nearly identical in depressed groups defined by either method. Of the 17,040 respondents with a PHQ-8 score ≥ 10, major depressive disorder was present in 49.7\%, other depressive disorder in 23.9\%, depressed mood or anhedonia in another 22.8\%, and no evidence of depressive disorder or depressive symptoms in only 3.5\%.
Limitations
The PHQ-8 diagnostic algorithm rather than an independent structured psychiatric interview was used as the criterion standard.
Conclusions
The PHQ-8 is a useful depression measure for population-based studies, and either its diagnostic algorithm or a cutpoint ≥ 10 can be used for defining current depression.},

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common mental disorders; however, there is no brief clinical measure for assessing GAD. The objective of this study was to develop a brief self-report scale to identify probable cases of GAD and evaluate its reliability and validity.Methods
A criterion-standard study was performed in 15 primary care clinics in the United States from November 2004 through June 2005. Of a total of 2740 adult patients completing a study questionnaire, 965 patients had a telephone interview with a mental health professional within 1 week. For criterion and construct validity, GAD self-report scale diagnoses were compared with independent diagnoses made by mental health professionals; functional status measures; disability days; and health care use.Results
A 7-item anxiety scale (GAD-7) had good reliability, as well as criterion, construct, factorial, and procedural validity. A cut point was identified that optimized sensitivity (89\%) and specificity (82\%). Increasing scores on the scale were strongly associated with multiple domains of functional impairment (all 6 Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey scales and disability days). Although GAD and depression symptoms frequently co-occurred, factor analysis confirmed them as distinct dimensions. Moreover, GAD and depression symptoms had differing but independent effects on functional impairment and disability. There was good agreement between self-report and interviewer-administered versions of the scale.Conclusion
The GAD-7 is a valid and efficient tool for screening for GAD and assessing its severity in clinical practice and research.},

	abstract = {AbstractBackground
The depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is a widely used depression screening instrument in nonpsychiatric settings. The PHQ-9 can be scored using different methods, including an algorithm based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria and a cut-off based on summed-item scores. The algorithm was the originally proposed scoring method to screen for depression. We summarized the diagnostic test accuracy of the PHQ-9 using the algorithm scoring method across a range of validation studies and compared the diagnostic properties of the PHQ-9 using the algorithm and summed scoring method at the proposed cut-off point of 10.
Methods
We performed a systematic review of diagnostic accuracy studies of the PHQ-9 using the algorithm scoring method to detect major depressive disorder (MDD). We used meta-analytic methods to calculate summary sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratios for diagnosing MDD of the PHQ-9 using algorithm scoring method. In studies that reported both scoring methods (algorithm and summed-item scoring at proposed cut-off point of ≥ 10), we compared the diagnostic properties of the PHQ-9 using these methods.
Results
We found 27 validation studies that validated the algorithm scoring method of the PHQ-9 in various settings. There was substantial heterogeneity across studies, which makes the pooled results difficult to interpret. In general, sensitivity was low whereas specificity was good. Thirteen studies reported the diagnostic properties of the PHQ-9 for both scoring methods. Pooled sensitivity for algorithm scoring method was lower while specificities were good for both scoring methods. Heterogeneity was consistently high; therefore, caution should be used when interpreting these results.
Interpretation
This review shows that, if the algorithm scoring method is used, the PHQ-9 has a low sensitivity for detecting MDD. This could be due to the rating scale categories of the measure, higher specificity or other factors that warrant further research. The summed-item score method at proposed cut-off point of ≥ 10 has better diagnostic performance for screening purposes or where a high sensitivity is needed.},

	abstract = {AbstractObjectives
To provide a standardized metric for the assessment of depression severity to enable comparability among results of established depression measures.
Study Design and Setting
A common metric for 11 depression questionnaires was developed applying item response theory (IRT) methods. Data of 33,844 adults were used for secondary analysis including routine assessments of 23,817 in- and outpatients with mental and/or medical conditions (46\% with depressive disorders) and a general population sample of 10,027 randomly selected participants from three representative German household surveys.
Results
A standardized metric for depression severity was defined by 143 items, and scores were normed to a general population mean of 50 (standard deviation = 10) for easy interpretability. It covers the entire range of depression severity assessed by established instruments. The metric allows comparisons among included measures. Large differences were found in their measurement precision and range, providing a rationale for instrument selection. Published scale-specific threshold scores of depression severity showed remarkable consistencies across different questionnaires.
Conclusion
An IRT-based instrument-independent metric for depression severity enables direct comparisons among established measures. The "common ruler" simplifies the interpretation of depression assessment by identifying key thresholds for clinical and epidemiologic decision making and facilitates integrative psychometric research across studies, including meta-analysis.},

	abstract = {Randomization tests are nonparametric statistical tests that obtain their validity by computationally mimicking the random assignment procedure that was used in the design phase of a study. Because randomization tests do not rely on a random sampling assumption, they can provide a better alternative than parametric statistical tests for analyzing data from single-case designs. In this article, an R package is described for use in designing single-case phase (AB, ABA, and ABAB) and alternation (completely randomized, alternating treatments, and randomized block) experiments, as well as for conducting statistical analyses on data gathered by means of such designs. The R code is presented in a step-by-step way, which at the same time clarifies the rationale behind single-case randomization tests.},

	abstract = {The treatment of chronic and recurrent depression is a priority for the development of new interventions. The maintenance of residual symptoms following acute treatment for depression is a risk factor for both chronic depression and further relapse/recurrence. This open case series provides the first data on a cognitive-behavioural treatment for residual depression that explicitly targets depressive rumination. Rumination has been identified as a key factor in the onset and maintenance of depression, which is found to remain elevated following remission from depression. Fourteen consecutively recruited participants meeting criteria for medication-refractory residual depression [Paykel, E.S., Scott, J., Teasdale, J.D., Johnson, A.L., Garland, A., Moore, R. et al., 1999. Prevention of relapse in residual depression by cognitive therapy—a controlled trial. Archives of General Psychiatry 56, 829–835] were treated individually for up to 12 weekly 60-min sessions. Treatment specifically focused on switching patients from less helpful to more helpful styles of thinking through the use of functional analysis, experiential/imagery exercises and behavioural experiments. Treatment produced significant improvements in depressive symptoms, rumination and co-morbid disorders: 71\% responded (50\% reduction on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) and 50\% achieved full remission. Treating depressive rumination appears to yield generalised improvement in depression and co-morbidity. This study provides preliminary evidence that rumination-focused CBT may be an efficacious treatment for medication-refractory residual depression.},
